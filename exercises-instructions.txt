Repeat the HTML/CSS Project, but this time use Bootstrap. There is no need to re-invent a brand or content for the
web site, just use the same ones you created for the original project.

For this Project, you have to delete the CSS file, and use all the Bootstrap default files, after which you may re-do
some of the content CSS.

(Do not worry if your web-site does not look the same, since you're using the default bootstrap).

Don't forget to deliver your stuff.
